# Steamed Hams But It's On My Watch 

Watchy is an Open Source E-Paper watch where you have control over pretty much everything. It has 8mb of memory though which makes some interesting things just possible.

Maybe there's such as thing as having too much control...

This actually technically tells the time. When not speed up, it shows a frame per minute of Steamed Hams over the day. Start of day: Start of an unforgettable lunchoen. End of day: help! heelllpp!.

I used a program I wrote, [MovieFramer](https://github.com/Sharkgrammer/MovieFramer), to split steamed hams into 60*24 frames.
